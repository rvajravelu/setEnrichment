New package originiated from function "mcea_routine_bootstrapped" from Medication Class Enrichment Anlaysis package v0.1.1.
- Version update from 0.1.1 to 2.0.0.
- Class labels can be text now. All class labels are converted to factors, then labels are added back to display results.

- Added an option to set a seed. Set deafult seed to 654321.
- Removed bootstrap percentage (defaulted to 100%) and replacement (defaulted to TRUE) options. There are options to change them within the code.
- Remove standardize ES parameter because it helps deal with class size imbalance. In reality, this was always TRUE in v0.1.1.
- Remove lowOR recip option and code. Using this would remove the causative/protective information, so now removed.
